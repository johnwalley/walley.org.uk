If you want to create better prompts for [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/app/) or learn a few different keywords you can try experimenting with using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to generate prompts for MidJourney.

This post is just a bit of fun and anything original comes from this video [Chat GPT + Midjourney V5.2 = Insane AI Art! (Process to Generate Prompts)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RCvbd5uLDY).

The first novel idea to me is training ChatGPT. We want to give ChatGPT an understanding of what a MidJourney prompt is. To do this we give it an instruction and paste in the contents of the [MidJourney documentation](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts) on prompts.

> Here are some notes for creating Midjourney Prompts I'd like you to understand:
>
> A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens...

ChatGPT replies with

> Got it! I have reviewed the notes for creating Midjourney prompts, and I understand the key concepts and tips for generating images using the Midjourney Bot. If you have any specific prompts or requests in mind, feel free to share them, and I'll do my best to assist you in creating the images you want. Remember to keep the prompts simple, descriptive, and specific to get the best results.

We now create a formula for ChatGPT to use

> I want you to use this formula to write Midjourney Prompts:
