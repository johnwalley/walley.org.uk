My open-source library, [Allotment](https://allotment.mulberryhousesoftware.com/), has been slowly gaining traction. It's around 20 thousand downloads per week.
While it isn't a huge number, it isn't nothing. There is also enough interest that a healthy number of issues and feature requests get submitted.

One statistic GitHub makes available is which other repositories use you as a dependency. The UI isn't great as you can't sort by stars so I used [ghtopdep](https://github.com/github-tooling/ghtopdep) to give me the top ten repositories by number of stars.

[JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/) is out in front with nearly 25 thousand starts. It lets you visualize your JSON data instantly into graphs and looks really smart.

[Notesnook](https://notesnook.com/) is a free (as in speech) & open-source note-taking app focused on user privacy & ease of use.

[Hetty](https://hetty.xyz/) is an HTTP toolkit for security research. Now, just because Allotment is listed as a dependency it doesn't mean it is actually used. This is the case here. Perhaps a developer was just ttrying out Allotment and forgot to remove it as a dependency when they were done.

All-in-all it's rewarding to see my work used in some popular projects.
