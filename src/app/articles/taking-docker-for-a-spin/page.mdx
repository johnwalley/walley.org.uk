[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) has intrigued me for some time now so I thought I'd take a closer look. Purely in a personal capacity, as until Docker supports Windows containers there are few applications at [work](http://www.red-gate.com/).

Let's pick something simple but non-trivial. I'd like to set up an instance of WordPress locally. WordPress relies on MySQL for storage so let's split the MySQL database out into its own container first.

`docker run --name db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example -d mysql`

<Image src={diagram1} alt="Diagram 1" />

We can then run the WordPress container and link it to our MySQL container like so.

`docker run --name wordpress --link db:mysql -p 8080:80 -d wordpress`

<Image src={diagram2} alt="Diagram 2" />

This is all fine and dandy but we need to persist the data beyond the lifetime of an ephemeral container.

We could mount a host directory as a data volume.

`docker run --name db -v /var/container_data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql`

This will mount the host directory, `/var/container_data/mysql`, into the container at `/var/lib/mysql`.

A problem with this approach is that it is no longer portable and the data directory is outside the control of Docker.

[Data Volume Containers](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#creating-and-mounting-a-data-volume-container), essentially data-only containers, provide the solution.

`docker run -v /dbdata --name dbdata mysql /bin/true`

The `bin/true` command is simply a dummy as docker needs something to run. It's also worth noting that the container doesn't need to be running to be used. Run docker ps -a to confirm that the container has been created.

We can then use this data container from our MySQL container.

`docker run --name db --volumes-from dbdata -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example -d mysql`

<Image src={diagram3} alt="Diagram 3" />

The data is encapsulated by our data container. Within the data container we could mount a host directory as a data volume. However it feels more Docker-like to let the container manage the data and access it through other containers. See wordpress-backup for an example of backing up and restoring a WordPress install.

If you're curious you can use `docker inspect dbdata` to pinpoint the location of the MySQL storage directory.
